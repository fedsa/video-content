David: **Howsit all. Thanks for the meetup!**

Justin Slack: **Hi David**

Martin Kruger: **Hi everyone**

Joel Mukanya: **Hello There**

Martin Kruger: **How's it going this fine evening?**

Schalk Venter: **Hello everyone!**

Schalk Venter: **Super excited to chat about some Jamstack!**

Martin Kruger: **ðŸ’ª**

Martin Kruger: **Windows key + .**

Martin Kruger: **Bet you didn't know that!**

Martin Kruger: **My 9 year old taught me lol**

Schalk Venter: **Ha!**

Schalk Venter: **Students told me as well ðŸ‘½**

Justin Slack: **What are you talking about? I am lost.**

Schalk Venter: **Emojis**

Justin Slack: **What is Windows key?**

Dylan: **haha!!**

David: **I enjoyed accessibility, was great.**

Justin Slack: **JAM = JavaScript, APIs, Markdown**

Martin Kruger: **Could you possibly go over drawback examples as well as how you would implement a Jamstack easily today i.e. is there a create-react-app equivalent**

Jordan Hailey: **I feel like Jamstack lends itself to a quick plug-n-play site, similar to Wordpress, Squarespace etc. So much complexity can be offloaded to a SaaS that provides a JavaScript SDK or REST API and you can devote so much more energy into UX**

Matt: **Is Markdown the same as markup? And would something like JSX fall under the markdown/up side of things? Also building on Martin's Q, what's a good way to get your feet wet if you've never worked with JAMstack**

Jordan Hailey: **Svelte can compile to static files using Sapper or Svelte Kit**

Jordan Hailey: **Static Site Generators and services like Netlify are amazing for rollbacks as well, so no worries about Friday builds!**

David: **angular universal**

David: **It's quite good**

David: **Thanks again for the meet up. Gotta drop off but presentation and conversation was great. Very well explained @Schalk and co. See ya next time.**

Jordan Hailey: **Might need to set up a google form to get questions and then one to vote on the top questions**
