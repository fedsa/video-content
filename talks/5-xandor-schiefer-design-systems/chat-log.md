Schalk Venter: **Remember to ask questions in text chat as we go.**

James Wilson: **Question:  are you aware if Figma calculates line-heights the same as they are on the web?**

Schalk Venter: **James, I'm pretty sure that it doesn't.**

Schalk Venter: **I think Justin might know as well?**

Justin: **https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/**

Schalk Venter: **https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom**

Schalk Venter: **Neat!**

Johannes Jonker: **Thanks for the talk!**

Michael Wagener: **Thanks for a great talk - very insightful…**

Johannes Jonker: **Where does Tailwind fit into your taxonomy of design systems?**

Ruan Benade: **Awesome talk :). Covered the important points! Have to leave!**

gerdusVZ: **organizationally who should be in control of the design system? product owner or design?**

Ismail Tofey (AUX): **How do you prefer designers to hand over designs to developers? Are developers expected to open Sketch or Figma files to inspect mocked up components?**

Anders Grové: **https://www.designbetter.co/designops-handbook/introducing-designops**

Brett Upton: **We use Zeplin for handover. It has Connected components which allows devs to click on a design element and see how and where it resides in code**

Johannes Jonker: **I have to run, but thanks for the interesting discussion! And thanks for organising Schalk and Justin!**

Chantelle Gobey: **Excellent talk, great covering of the foundations**

Anders Grové: **What is your preference on naming conventions for design tokens, and should they relate back to your actual CSS naming convention?**

Paul Schoeman: **Thanks, guys**

Ismail Tofey (AUX): **Let’s say you want to make your design system public, in the same way Material UI does it. Do you custom design this interface or do you use a boilerplate like https://www.catalog.style**

James Wilson: **Question: how far away do you think we are from being replaced for Artificial intelligence**

Schalk Venter: **That's a great resource James!**

James Wilson: **And which way do you think it will swing? Will it swing more to the designer… making developers obsolete?**

Michael Wagener: **Thanks guys - fantastic talk - really informative and definitely looking forward to the slides and the next meet-up.  Thanks all :)**

gerdusVZ: **think AI will be able to translate design to code;**

gerdusVZ: **but not functionality and structure**

Schalk Venter: **James, I'm actually reading https://www.amazon.com/How-Speak-Machine-Computational-Thinking/dp/039956442X at the moment, it's a great book that goes into this.**

Ismail Tofey (AUX): **How do you sell a design system to stakeholders who may not see the benefit?**

James Wilson: **Phew!**

gerdusVZ: **good luck to AI overlords trying to understand what a client actually wants**

Brett Upton: **@Ismail, if you have the time you do**

Brett Upton: **https://medium.com/@didoo/measuring-the-impact-of-a-design-system-7f925af090f7**

Ismail Tofey (AUX): **Do you guys use px? What about rem’s and em’s?**

Anders Grové: **shots fired :D**

Leandri Nieuwoudt: **I need to bounce, but thanks so much for a great talk Xandor! Some great questions & discussions as well! Will catch up on the last bit on the YouTube link ;)**

Schalk Venter: **Thanks for joining Leandri!**

gerdusVZ: **thank you was fun**

Schalk Venter: **Thanks for joining everyone!**

Anders Grové: **thanks, cheers!**

Ismail Tofey (AUX): **Thanks! Great talk. Cheers**

Patrick O'Donoghue: **Thank you for everything. Was really informative and interesting. Cheers**

James Wilson: **Thanks everyone!**
