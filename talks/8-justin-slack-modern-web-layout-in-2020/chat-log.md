Schalk Venter: **Let's see how many people find their way here.**

Liezel Conradie: **hi, can someone please say something, I want to check my sound**

Johannes Jonker: **(Keeping my camera off so I don’t subject you to my dinner, if you don’t mind.)**

Schalk Venter: **Did that work?**

Wikus: **it's probably a "back-end" issue**

Callum Oberholzer: **Great. Keen guys**

Schalk Venter: **Feel free to ask any questions in text chat.**

Schalk Venter: **As Justin goes**

catonice: **Yep DA still has stickers**

Schalk Venter: **If Win Amp was a website :D**

Mishkah: **Oh thank goodness, what have I missed??? :’(**

Mishkah: **The meetup website is down**

catonice: **It's charming XD but probably not accessible**

Schalk Venter: **Yeah, super unfortunate timing Mishkah**

catonice: **The beginning of HTML mishkah**

catonice: **History lesson :)**

Mishkah: **Does anyone know how I can change my name on Zoom, My friend Mishkah attended an online interview on zoom and forgot to change it back to my name. I’m Miriam. Hello everyone :)**

catonice: **Heyo!**

Schalk Venter: **Heya Miriam.**

Schalk Venter: **I think you need to log into Zoom.com to do it**

Mishkah: **Ahyt, thanks :)**

Schalk Venter: **Back when we needed to pay money for advertising to convince people that standards were a good thing**

catonice: **When is CSS4 coming out? :P**

Schalk Venter: **Ha, there is probably never going to be a CSS4 or HTML6.**

catonice: **COMPAQ! That was our old pc password**

Boats: **pentium 4 processor ad**

Schalk Venter: **HTML5 + CSS3 were complete changes in approaches to speccing HTML and CSS.**

Schalk Venter: **W3C is now doing incremental releases instead of completely new versions.**

Schalk Venter: **So to answer your question Catonice probably never. :)**

catonice: **Dang!**

Johannes Jonker: **Triggered… 🙈**

Nathan Shepherd: **The float "Oof"**

catonice: **Oh lawd I had to do this**

catonice: **Until flexbox <3**

Mishkah: **Flexbox just makes life easier :)**

catonice: **flexbox is my saviour**

catonice: **Oh this is new to me**

Nathan Shepherd: **Whoa, breaking news! I didn't know that (regarding alignment props).**

catonice: **Object FIT!**

catonice: **Sjoe its been awhile**

catonice: **That should be a shirt!**

Johannes Jonker: **Lockdown has had me flex-grow:3**

catonice: **badumtss**

catonice: **margin left vs flex end?**

Nathan Shepherd: **Yea, Microsoft - that was surprising, considering at the time Microsoft (IE) wasn't innovating but hampering progress.**

Johannes Jonker: **Is it possible to do relative positioning for grid-items? e.g. “grid-row-start: -1” which would position the grid-item 1 row up from its ‘natural’ row.**

Schalk Venter: **The frunit**

catonice: **the fru(n)it**

Leandri Nieuwoudt: **That’s actually suuuper useful**

catonice: **XD**

Nathan Shepherd: **Yep**

Nathan Shepherd: **It's evolution baby**

Nathan Shepherd: **Distributed alignment FTW**

Boats: **sorry guys I need to go, enjoy <3 thanks justin**

Johannes Jonker: **How does min-content and max-content differ from width:auto?**

Leandri Nieuwoudt: **I didn’t know this! Poopy that it’s only on Firefox though**

Schalk Venter: **yup!**

Johannes Jonker: **👍**

catonice: **Yep I gotta go as well, enjoy!**

Schalk Venter: **Thanks for joining Catonice!**

Freddie du Plessis: **thanks Justin!!!**

Johannes Jonker: **Thanks Justin, that was super interesting!**

Riyaadh Fakier: **Thanks, Justin.**

Nathan Shepherd: **Awesome stuff. Thanks, Justin - picked up a few things here tonight.**

Freddie du Plessis: **Would it be worthwhile to focus on/develop primarily with logical properties instead of the more traditional properties?**

Freddie du Plessis: **both of you ;p**

Schalk Venter: **https://kyusuf.com/post/almost-complete-guide-to-flexbox-without-flexbox/**

Freddie du Plessis: **Justin, how does spacing components fit in with modern layout methods?**

Leandri Nieuwoudt: **Good point Schalk**

Johannes Jonker: **Unfortunately I need to excuse myself, but thanks again for the talk Justin and thanks for organising, Schalk! 👋
Wikus: **Thank you guys, see you in the next one. Keep up the good work.**

Nathan Shepherd: **Question for Justin. What problems, in terms of layout on the web, do you think still need to be addressed? And how do you see that (most likely) happening?**

Leandri Nieuwoudt: **I also need to pop off, thanks so much for this interesting talk Justin & Schalk!**

Nathan Shepherd: **Virtualized lists: A lot of work for the browser (DOM painting). And how would that affect traditional SEO.**

Nathan Shepherd: **Do you think a Technical Committee (i.e. TC39) would help address the issue of browser vendor priorities and how they differ from each other, or do you think that will largely remain a market-related issue?**

Nathan Shepherd: **Solution: more JS libraries :D**

Nathan Shepherd: **...and frameworks**

Freddie du Plessis: **Cheers guys, Dinner is calling. Thanks again Justin!**

Riyaadh Fakier: **Cheers Fred.**

Riyaadh Fakier: **Cheers all. Very informative session. Thanks Justin & Schalk.**

Nathan Shepherd: **Thanks guys, for the 2020 events! and for future events!**

Nathan Shepherd: **Cheers!**

Justin Slack: **Thanks Nathan**
