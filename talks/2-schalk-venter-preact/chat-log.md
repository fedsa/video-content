Justin Slack: **Hi everyone**

Justin Slack: **Thanks for joining and please post questions for Schalk here**

Ebenezer Mathebula: **Hi. How large is the Preact community? The most frustrating thing for me as a developer would be to start working with a framework where you find it hard to get help online. Are there platforms that are made to help developers working with Preact?**

Nathan Shepherd: **hi Schalk, are there any features unique to Preact that React doesn't implement?**

mcurrin: **Helloooo, its Kirsten, Zoom bombing your talk - kapow! ;-)**

Justin Slack: **Hi Kirsten :)**

Nathan Shepherd: **Looks like Routing is built-in as well?**

Ebenezer Mathebula: **How does Preact handle page headers that would help with SEO? With React, you can build a react app on top of Nextjs, and NextJs allows us to inject headers on our pages. You said Preact is a Framework on its own. Does it have a feature that allows us to inject headers dynamically to each page?**

Nathan Shepherd: **Right! Gotcha!**

Xandor Schiefer: **Next officially supports preact**

Xandor Schiefer: **They have a starter template for it**

Justin Slack: **Thanks Xandor**

mcurrin: **I came across the same thing - the "crawl budget" gets used up by Google crawler parsing JS so it crawls much less than if using static HTML**

Justin Slack: **Thanks Mike**

mcurrin: **There are tools like presite which convert a build directory which runs needing to JS to an output that works with JS turned off**

mcurrin: **https://github.com/egoist/presite**

mcurrin: **Don't know if works for preact, but it works for React and Vue**

mcurrin: **react-scripts build && presite ./build**

Xandor Schiefer: **https://linaria.now.sh has a styled components API, but compiles to static CSS (it uses CSS variables/custom properties for dynamism). They support preact.**

Justin Slack: **https://bem.info/**

mcurrin: **There's a Preact starter on vercel.com for a .now.sh free site which uses server-side rendering i.e not static site. Works for React and others**

mcurrin: **Here's the starter it generated for me**
