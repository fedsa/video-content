Douglas Van Der Merwe: **Can you share the link to animatable?**

Justin Slack: **https://projects.verou.me/animatable/**

Douglas Van Der Merwe: **Thank you @Justin.**

Bradley Ngubane: **Thank you**

Schalk Venter: **Nice! It's essentially time-travel for animation debugging**

Justin Slack: **Firefox also has an animation inspector if that‚Äôs your browser.**

Boats: **Goooo Mandia !! :) **

John Roux: **Could be useful for something like 0->29.99% and then a near instant transition to the 30% keyrframe**

John Roux: **How to draw something in css: Remove it and slowly add it again :D**

Douglas Van Der Merwe: **How can I check if a svg is single-line?**

Boats: **Ben understands all that math :P**

Justin Slack: **The short answer is paths and strokes rather than fills**

Justin Slack: **But I may be completely wrong :)**

Boats: **that's actually pretty cool**

Douglas Van Der Merwe: **Sorry, mic issues**

Martin Kruger: **3D is becoming a bigger part of the web and it can be argued that the web will largely be 3d and/or virtual reality in the future. Is CSS preparing for 3D content?**

Douglas Van Der Merwe: **@Mandia mentioned it earlier during the "self-drawing star"**

Ben Janecke (otherben) | Vulcan Labs: **lol staging**

Martin Kruger: **You have 100 layers that are stacked and all have the same background colour. Are the layers behind the main layer all being rendered, ending up in extra processing power being used? Or does it know to not render out the other layers?**

Boats: **Thanks Mandia :)**

John Roux: **XD no prod deploys this late :D**

andy: **Thanks Mandia !!**

Anja Gregori: **Awesome, thanks Mandia!!**

Leandri: **Brilliant 'chefs kiss**

Justin Slack: **Great talk from DevConf 2019 on the rendering process**

thabana: **This has been so informative..Thank you**

brett scheepers: **Wonderful talk thank you very much**

Arthur Swan: **Probably a dumb question, but why does the transition property go in the main rule declaration block and not in the :hover pseudoclass block? It seems counterintuitive to me**

Douglas Van Der Merwe:**"DOOM"?**

Schalk Venter: **Yeah, Douglas this is it: https://keithclark.co.uk/labs/css-fps/**

Ben Janecke (otherben) | Vulcan Labs: **"Cascading" style sheets **

Arthur Swan: **That does actually make sense, thanks!**

John Roux: **Did someone say scope creep :D?**

Justin Slack: **üòÄ**

Bradley Ngubane: **Thanks for the enlightenment. Enjoyed!**

Justin Slack: **Just popping this here**

Hendrik de Wet: **Any advice on how would you implement/handle a custom font-face to prevent FOUT during a loading animation?**

Hendrik de Wet: **Noooo lol**

Boats: **XD**

Hendrik de Wet: **Assume I would have to use JS**

John Roux: **There's basically no way you could do that in pureCSS though right? (not the in-lining, but the font checks)**
	
Ben Janecke (otherben) | Vulcan Labs: **Sounds like this needs a webpack loader**

Hendrik de Wet: **Tried the pre load attribute didn't work**

Hendrik de Wet: **LOL**

John Roux: **:D 6 hours of engineering later => Make a dang SVG**

Hendrik de Wet: **Cool... thanks Justin!**
