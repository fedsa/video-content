Nicolaas Kotze: **After the GIT talk, a great reference that works for me is the Pro Git ebook/HTML that is freely available at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. I think some Git changes in terms will be "master".**

Schalk Venter: **Atlassian also has a great resource in terms of learning Git: https://www.atlassian.com/git**

Nicolaas Kotze: **A nice GUI tool I recently switched to that made Git easier for me since I do not Git every week is Git Cola at https://git-cola.github.io/**

Schalk Venter: **I used to use https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ for a long time, but the VS Code integration got so good that I just straight up use it as is nowadays.**

Schalk Venter: **Link to Visual Studio Code for anyone interested: https://code.visualstudio.com/**

Schalk Venter: **It's 100% free. I use it as well.**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Password: pAsswoRd12345**

Schalk Venter: **pAsswoRd12345! - needs a special character**

douglas: **just a quick question, isn't it easier to use ssh over http.**

Schalk Venter: **I actually want to ask Rob about this after the talk. I actually prefer using HTTPS instead of SSH.**

Schalk Venter: **The idea of being able to accidently type `git push` and boom my code is live feels a bit scary to me.**

Schalk Venter: **I prefer to have a password in-between that and it actually going live.**

Schalk Venter: **Might just be a personal preference.**

douglas: **atleast with ssh you don't need to enter password everytime.**

Schalk Venter: **Robert you can do a PR for your Hello World TXT, but I'm gonna decline it ;P**

Schalk Venter: **Or actually I'll accept it so you can demo how it works.**

Schalk Venter: **Will just delete afterwards**

yegz: **A pull request, is basically asking to push to the original one?**

Schalk Venter: **Yup.**

Schalk Venter: **I often find "pull" confusing, since you are actually asking to "Push" code to the original.**

Schalk Venter: **But the term is "pull request"**

Ryan: **how do you keep your own repository up to date after the initial fork, to get alll changes that have been made by others**

Nicolaas Kotze: **I thought Pull Request was satire...**

When you are the maintainer of a respository and a contributor do a large change "Pull Request" of their code into your master branch, it can be like a "Pull Teeth" amount of effort.**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Question: When is it good to use TAGS?**

douglas: **is it better to use a cli for github, or is it better to use a gui as a command line is it more efficient.**

Nicolaas Kotze: **@douglas: It is useful to learn the cli commands for when you use cloud instances or a Raspberry Pi (low RAM).**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Question: Merge onflicts!!!**

Ryan: **is it better to push changes then pull or pull then push?**

Nicolaas Kotze: ***Question*: Gti vs SVN...What would be the key questions to ask when selecting one at the beginning of a project?**

Ryan: **Thanks**

Nicolaas Kotze: ***Question*: I heard rumors (in the past) that Git was not reliable with binary files. Why would someone say that?**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Ah, so it could corrupt compressed(ZIP) files?**

Nicolaas Kotze: **okay, so storage may become an issue with large files. thanks.**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Done with question...I promise. Thanks!!! XD**

Schalk Venter: **Nah, these are good questions Nic!**

SamKenpachi: ***Question*:How can pull requests be done on the CLI without using the Github interface.**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Oh gosh! Sourceforge days!!! XD**

Nicolaas Kotze: **SourceSafe!**

Bradley Cowie: **FB still big on mercurial**

yegz: **Can you explain the rebase/merge again please**

yegz: **sorry, lost me a bit**

Schalk Venter: **No worries Yegz!**

Nicolaas Kotze: **@SamKenpachi: **I found this link. https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Seems like you have to use the URL**

Robert MacLean: **Here is the command to update the fork from the original: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7244456**

Ryan: **Thank you!!!**

yegz: **Is there like a checkout/check in functionality? so you can see if anyone else is working on a piece of code that you might also want to work on? merge conflicts are scary**

Nicolaas Kotze: **Seems for GitHub CLI you check this out https://cli.github.com/**

Nicolaas Kotze: **wait**

Nicolaas Kotze: ***Question*: Would Git be considered "blockchain"?**

Nicolaas Kotze: **DONE!!!**

Ryan: **Thank you very much Robert**

yegz: **Thanks Robert! and the Team for the tutorial**

yegz: **seeing it live was great, it sometimes seems much more difficult than it is**
