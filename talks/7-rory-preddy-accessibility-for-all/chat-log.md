Craig Stroberg: **Evening :)**

Schalk Venter: **Hey Craig!**

Rory Preddy: **aka.ms/for-all**

Schalk Venter: **Reminder to ask question in text chat if you have.**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Woah, this Immersive Reader is amazing!**

Chante van der Walt: **What is the name of that chrome add-on?**

Tania Melnyczuk: **You didn't switch on many things for it to check, I think**

Schalk Venter: **Loving that <$0.01**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Is there a WordPress plugin for Immersive Reader?**

Justin: **Accessibility Insights**

Schalk Venter: **Thanks Justin. :)**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Thank you, this was very valuable!**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Natalie and I are from the Western Cape Network on Disability. If you ever need blind, deafblind, deaf, dyslexic, etc. testers, we may be able to help you recruit.**

Schalk Venter: **Tania, we'd be super keen to follow up accessibility talk.**

Schalk Venter: **Awesome! I'll definitely follow up!**

Tania Melnyczuk: **People forget that disabled people may actually have MONEY too. They are customers.**

Justin: **Indeed**

Natalie Johnson: **There are actually no disabled people. There are people with impairments who have been disabled by their environments in which they need to function**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Yep.**

Justin: **That’s a great way to approach it Natalie.**

Tania Melnyczuk: **It is also the way the UN Convention on Disabilities looks at it, in slightly different words. That's the basis for the South African White Paper on Disability which is supposed to be turned into legislation.**

Justin: **Thanks Tania**

Chante van der Walt: **Can you paste that in the chat as well please**

Tania Melnyczuk: **As a matter of interest (since you're from Microsoft :-D ), why are we in Zoom and not in Teams?**

Justin: **Because it’s a FEDSA meetup :)**

Rory Preddy: **https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/**

Chante van der Walt: **Thanks**

Chante van der Walt: **What is Aria? Not sure about the spelling**

Justin: **Accessible Rich Internet Applications**

Chante van der Walt: **Thank you**

Justin: **Lots of resources here**

Justin: **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA**

Craig Stroberg: **Whoops my very site I needed to make accessible 4 years ago I set the tabbing. My testing was covering my eyes and listening **

Tania Melnyczuk: **It's sort of odd that those core personas don't have a dyslexic and a person with seizure disorders, or someone with gross/fine motor issues.**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Amazing, I have never thought of tabbing. This is a totally new lesson for me. Now I wonder about all my sites!**

Justin: **Tabbing through a site can be a real eye-opener.**

Craig Stroberg: **you should be covering your eyes when tabbing**

Justin: **Just for info Shift-tab can tab “backwards”**

Tania Melnyczuk: **Thank you all! Gonna go tab something now!**

Rory Preddy: **cheers**

Chante van der Walt: **Thank you**

karla: **Thank you!**

Natalie Johnson: **Thank you for an informative session**

Craig Stroberg: **Thank you. Enjoy the bar tabs**
