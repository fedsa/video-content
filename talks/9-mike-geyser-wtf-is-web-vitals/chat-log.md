Jacques: **Maybe a link to that meetup?**

Schalk Venter: **Here is link to meetup: https://www.meetup.com/Jozi-JS/**

Kiffie Liversage: **There is audio**

Vicki: **I have noticed a trend in our dev team opting fot AMP only sites for optimization. What are your thoughts on this?**

Schalk Venter: **I was hoping for some spicy AMP questions :D**

Dylan: **Is there any possible source of FIELD data that is more recent than BigQuery, Crux API or Page Insights? Without having to rely on LAB data like lighthouse. I'm finding  BigQuery / Crux API / Page Insights takes too long to update for it to be useful.**

Vicki: **Thank you for the clear answer about AMP. I believe we need to apply tech to make the web better and not only to rate high in a carousel.**

Mike Geyser: **Totally! <3**

Kiffie Liversage: **PWA’s require ServiceWorkers which are not available on first load. Does the web vitals factor that in? Or does it only look at the “first load” experience?**

Kiffie Liversage: **Does the layout shift factor in client side routing on SPAs? e.g. pathname changing?**

Vicki: **Is there anyway that one can collect RUM data yourself? We made an attempt utilizing GTM and GA. but it was a bit iffy.**

Vicki: **And is it worth the attempt?**

Vicki: **Good to know thanks.**

Kiffie Liversage: **Ok, thanks**

Vicki: **Would you at the end of this meet, provide links to the tools that were mentioned during the q&a?**

Michael Wagener (Cape Town, SA): **I have to run… good to meet you Mike and thanks for a great talk - thanks Schalk for organising - chat to you soon - if you’d like to connect with me (anyone) - I am a Scrum Master - LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwagener - Bye bye :)**

Schalk Venter: **Thanks Michael W!**

Vicki: **Surely core web vitals is not the only ranking factor?**

Keagan Bester: **Also haveto run, internet is out and mobile data is running out too. Thanks for the great insights**

Kiffie Liversage: **I recently rebuilt a home page in next.js. The home page has a lot of content ~ 1800 dom nodes. Most of the content doesn’t need js - but next.js still does the hydration. This tends to incur a large total blocking time which is hurting the lighthouse performance score. I’m interested in how people would approach improving this**

Mike Geyser: **That sucks. :(**

Hylton Clementson: **thank you Mike**

Kiffie Liversage: **Thanks for your talk. Have a great evening**

Nathan Shepherd: **Thanks Mike. It was awesome.**

Alex Bossi: **Thanks Mike**

Kiffie Liversage: **The lighthouse performance score did massively improve from ~30 to ~50-60 - so it wasn’t a lose**

Kiffie Liversage: **Like, Subscribe and Comment :D**

Nathan Shepherd: **Looking forward to it!**
