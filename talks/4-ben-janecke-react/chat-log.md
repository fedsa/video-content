Nathan Shepherd: **Good evening all. Happy to join. Thanks to FEDSA for hosting another event. Looking forward to the talk and the topic.**

Darryl Le Roux: **Surely we can play clapping sounds in the background like the premier league and their “crowds” :)**

Boats: **That just blew my braincell**

Tim Trewartha: **I was wondering about classnames("a", "b") - I haven't used this before, what is it and what is the advantage of just having className="a b"?**

Jaques: **From my experience, classnames gives you a bit more power, as well as legibility, You can add additional classnames as a dictionary - that you can easily switch on and off , so like: `classname("ui button", { 'class1': true, 'class2': false, 'class3': value > 8 })` which will build up a nice classname based on the true/false values in that object**

Tim Trewartha: **thanks Jacques**

Schalk Venter: **https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames**

Jaques:
```
classNames('foo', 'bar'); // => 'foo bar'
classNames('foo', { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
classNames({ 'foo-bar': true }); // => 'foo-bar'
classNames({ 'foo-bar': false }); // => ''
classNames({ foo: true }, { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
classNames({ foo: true, bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
```
