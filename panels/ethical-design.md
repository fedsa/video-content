Tess Gouws:  **hi everyone**

Tess Gouws:  **those are a LOT of albums!!**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Hello Tess**

Tess Gouws:  **fancy seeing you here**

Tess Gouws:  **:P**

Schalk Venter:  **Hey Everyone!**

Schalk Venter:  **Welcome!**

Tess Gouws:  **woohoo!**

Tess Gouws:  **and then of course, justice according to whom?**

Vincent Hofmann:  **And justice for all :)**

Tess Gouws:  **the road to hell is paved with good intentions**

annua:  **True story**

barrybotha:  **Should we ask questions here in the chat ?**

Liesel Bester:  **Yes please**

Schalk Venter:  **Barry, yup.**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Yes please**

Tess Gouws:  **Legal vs. ethical...? Apartheid was legal. So was child marriage.**

Michael Wagener (Cape Town, SA):  **Sorry guys, I have to jump…  super-interesting conversation… cheers :-)**

Tess Gouws:  **in other words, agreed Liz.**

Christopher Le Roux:  **Also interesting to think of that idea of ethics being different to everyone and so that is also why it is important to make and think inclusively**

barrybotha:  **I am wondering where one would draw the line in “neutral” kind of products. As an example, a global chat platform can be designed with good practices, ethical patterns but can be used for harm. In this particular case locking it down more will break functionality and user’s rights to use these platforms. I’m don’t think this responsibi**

barrybotha:  **oops**

barrybotha:  **… necessarily lies with the designer**

Tess Gouws:  **agreed, Christopher**

Vincent Hofmann:  **@Barry I’ll try pick up on this, by exploring what “neutrality” might mean, probably tangentially, but maybe we will get somewhere from there.**

barrybotha:  **Excellent**

Tess Gouws:  **@Barry - perhaps its not always up to the designer.. yet. But considering what we've seen in the design space of late, isn't it time that we as designers start thinking about this proactively instead of just leaving it up to the client / the users?**

Tess Gouws:  **at some point we have to start knowing better and doing better.**

Karen Breytenbach:  **If ethics is subjective but we design for big audiences, what are the basic non-negotiable principles in terms of design that does not create harm?**

Tess Gouws:  **That said, being able to push back is often its own kind of privilege, and not always a possibility**

barrybotha:  **Yes, I think designers should. My point is more about that some systems should exist and have the right to exist and may still be used for harm by bad actors.**

Schalk Venter:  **Loving it Vincent!**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **How do we navigate creating ethical products in a Capitalist Realist world? Every time I discuss ethics, it always boils down to the current economic system (late capitalism).**

Justin Slack:  **Mandla have you read Mark Fisher?**

Christopher Le Roux:  **Yeah Vincent, we are here to know better, we are a human buffer rn between what machines can do and what we can do, we can think deeply and make decisions such as those on ethics and that is why diversity in voices in conversations like this is so important**

Dylan:  **is demanding poverty not an unethical move though?**

Tess Gouws:  **it should come with its own responsibility,  agreed**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Absa online banking confronts you with Lotto tickets before you even get into the app**

Christine Moore:  **I’m a designer in a whole different industry (that’s causing a sh*tload of harm), and to Vincent’s point, there is a lot of pressure on the companies to change. Internationally there is already a great shift, but still lagging greatly in RSA.**

Tess Gouws:  **Yet**

Vincent Hofmann:  **@Christopher, absolutely, if we took tooling and artefacts away from design school, what would we teach?**

Christopher Le Roux:  **The same way users drive what is made, I think it is an interesting thing to think about designers also striving for such a power because we are in demand (I am a student btw so just throwing in whats catching my attention)**

barrybotha:  **A good start is to build products that solve problems and not create them. If it’s not solving one, it is probably creating one.**

Christopher Le Roux:  **@Vic. YES**

Schalk Venter:  **Christopher, I actually think the fact that you are a student makes your input here even more important.**

Christopher Le Roux:  ***@Vincent sorry**

Tess Gouws:  **Agreed @Schalk**

Vincent Hofmann:  **@Barry I don’t think that’s always true, needs are ambiguous, I always used to say “we build for their needs”. Until I was confronted with the idea that in fact we should contemplate whether the need does harm to non human actors (planet, animals) etc.

Vincent Hofmann:  **Values Based Design (recent release) is such a good read on the idea of neutrality, if you’re keen on thinking further about that, it’s about the idea that all products and services are imbued with our values. Therefore we fold politics, ethics etc. into the “thing”**

Christopher Le Roux:  **Shucks, thanks Tess and Schalk**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **Yes, universities and colleges have failed us; I had to fight to use an ethical design methodology for my master's thesis. My supervisor initially argued that it was political :(**

barrybotha:  **Thanks - will give it a read.**

Tess Gouws:  **There is a native American philosophy ( i think) that talks about thinking about the impact 7 generations into the future. Do we ever really stop to think about extended reach?**

Bertus Kock:  **I remember at the beginning of UX and in order for businesses to start taking it seriously, we had to proof the business value. What do you see as the business value of design ethics? I guess, do you have success stories of ethical profit design?**

Tess Gouws:  **love that, Liz.**

Tess Gouws:  **don't want to be overdramatic, but there needs to be some kind of acknowledgement of the responsibilities that designers should have**

Tess Gouws:  **the question of course is who controls the inner circle, and grants access / runs the risk of becoming little more than gatekeeping**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **Exactly. So this whole topic of democratising design is a difficult one. Gatekeeping design is bad. But everyone claiming to be designers is also not great**

Christopher Le Roux:  **(preface Schalk is my lecturer) but as he always say, anyone can design a single page site on webflow or a app design on figma, we are here to know how to and what to think about it**

Christopher Le Roux:  ***says**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **My current fav dark pattern is Apple’s Live Photos :’-D**

Bertus Kock:  **@schalk @Lizette The idea of everyone designing and not properly trained... isn't the challenge that the assumption is that the only place to "take part" sits in design, when it doesn't. You can do your part towards the "product" by applying ethics in your field as a contributor of the product, may it be marketing, business, etc.**

The wider question can be: What can each "job" can contribute to be an ethical company/product?**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Should the person doing the design be both oversight and practitioner?**

Schalk Venter:  **Bertus, this is the exact problem with accessibility at the moment in software.**

Schalk Venter:  **It's not that someone specific is to blame, but more just death by a 1000 cuts.**

Tess Gouws:  **exactly**

Bertus Kock:  **@vincent Don't think so. Everyone in the company is accountable**

Schalk Venter:  **My general take is that the biggest problem at the moment is that a lot of teams still follow Waterfall Models :)**

Bertus Kock:  **Mini-Waterfall**

Tess Gouws:  **ha**

Dylan:  **is there any sort of ethics working group that designers and devs can join, with a guideline that serves as a working document and that can drive 'regulation' from the bottom up?**

Candice Sergeant:  **@Bertus - agree, it should be for the whole team to keep questioning what they're doing, and is it ethical or not. Diversity of voices is important, but at the same time the reality of most corporate environments is KPI based, so if ethical product dev isn't part of it, they won't take it as priority probably. And then to @Annu's point now, it won't be thought about, 100%**

Schalk Venter:  **Dylan, might not be specific what you are looking for but I follow https://techworkerscoalition.org/ quite closely.**

Schalk Venter:  **They do amazing work.**

Vincent Hofmann:  **@Dylan there are communities of practice emerging in the Speculative Design space, and the ‘Society Centred’  design work.**

Christopher Le Roux:  **@bertus on your response to Vincent, I think that is valuable, because one person surely cant decide ? it depends on if there is a team of designers or just one because that will mean different solutions, however a all over solution would (I think) be via legislation**

Bertus Kock:  **Not what I mean by that. Have the conversation with every department. Marketing: List your tools. Which ones of these are ethical questionable and which aren't. Design: Which of your tools and processes are ethical questionable and which not? As a company we remove the non-ethical tools/processes**

Tess Gouws:  **what you measure is what you get. which organisation actually measures ethics?**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **I think there are a few tools, such as, value sensitive design and another method developed by Morten Rand-Hendriksen**

Tess Gouws:  **cynics? here? nooo..**

Christopher Le Roux:  **Although legislation is not necessarily genuine ethics**

Kitso Sedumedi:  **Wouldn’t the ethics of any design be addressed by stakeholders of the need of the designed service and product?**

Tess Gouws:  **if the stakeholders cared**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **It should, yes. But they often are more concerned more about deadlines or potential ROI**

Tess Gouws:  **Indeed.**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **The worst is when stakeholders get angry by people talking about ethical concerns of products**

Tess Gouws:  **Black Mirror is written based on exploring "whats the worst thing that could happen with this piece of tech"**

Tess Gouws:  **what keeps us from doing the same thing? whats the worst thing that could happen with this design?**

Christopher Le Roux:  **anti user stories**

Tess Gouws:  **Makes me want to smack those stakeholders upside the head @ Liz -_-**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **So I’ve heard a designer talk about how she always does the “black mirror” test with her projects. I.e. what is the worst thing someone would be able to do with her designs
Tess Gouws:  **hah.. that has a ring to it Christopher**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **From a historical perspective, humans had revolutions (American and French) to get rid of feudalism, and they ended up with capitalism which was basically the same oppressive system LOL**

Tess Gouws:  **Why don't we all start doing that, @Liz? amongst ourselves as (conscious) designers and hope that the trend catches**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **It would be so great. I.e. realising that by someone financial abuse if you**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **Whoops**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **I meant it would be good if people realise that by only allow one person to sign into joint bank accounts, it allows for financial abuse**

barrybotha:  **I do believe that products will do better if designed to bring value rather than making you addicted as users will appreciate it. There is a place where ethical design and commercial success can cross and be happy.**

Christopher Le Roux:  **Oef, I'm going to have to hop off, thanks for the chat so far, hope everyone has a good evening**

Tess Gouws:  **Go well Christopher**

Tess Gouws:  **communities of practice?**

Schalk Venter:  **Thanks for joining Chris!**

Bertus Kock:  **What is the framework?! :)**

Tess Gouws:  **we need a reading list Vince**

Vincent Hofmann:  **https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making/**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Please tell us more about the ethical checklist/ framework you mentioned @vincent**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Ah ok**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Saw the link now**

Vincent Hofmann:  **What other kinds of reads would you like? I keep a pattern library for ethics in design.**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Some more thinking:**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Cennyd Bowles gives us prompting questions to establish an ethical test. Each question is linked to a school of thought: From deontology, we get “What if everyone did what I’m about to do” - what if everyone made it impossible to click close on that annoying marketing pop-up. From Utilitarianism we get “Am I maximising happiness for the greatest number? Am I minimizing suffering for as many people as I can? To riff off of one of Cenny’d ideas I thought I’d add a new one, “would I want this to appear as a trending topic linked to my twitter account?” to explore virtue ethics  Lastly the question I found the most difficult to grapple with, from Deontology again, “am I treating people as ends or means?”**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **Thanks for sharing Vincent**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Thanks - I’m writing a blog on this talk so anything that is provocative and practically useful to designers would be great**

Tess Gouws:  **awesome**

Vincent Hofmann:  **I didn’t say it that eloquently.**

Bertus Kock:  **Jip, the eyes go.**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **My eyes went when I was 9 :D**

Justin Slack:  **I only started wearing glasses after I turned 40.**

Bertus Kock:  **Mobile First to Accessibility First**

Tess Gouws:  **Just as relevant as any other**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Alan Cooper writes a lot about Ancestral Thinking about this very reason, what are we doing as designers for the people who come next (or who wear glasses)**

Tess Gouws:  **be a good ancestors:)**

Tess Gouws:  **-a   o_O**

Christine Moore:  **But how do you ‘force’ clients to change? I personally think that change will only come when the customer/user becomes educated around ethics. The industry need to create awareness.**

Bertus Kock:  **What is meant with increase diversity without running into the bias of demographics?**

Christine Moore:  **Totally agree Liesel!**

Bertus Kock:  **Plastic bags didn't work**

barrybotha:  **Thats what happened with Nike in the early example. It was consumer driven.**

Tess Gouws:  **No.**

Tess Gouws:  **Hell no.**

Bertus Kock:  **Should you go and change Amazon or not take the job?**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **True, everything is design**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  ***designed**

Bertus Kock:  **The sweets line towards the till**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **Exactly**

Schalk Venter:  **I think it's also important to note that when we ask people to vote with their wallets is that we have different size wallets, so by nature that very undemocratic.**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **It’s literally what’s happening with sustainability. Companies are asking what *we* are going to pollute less, while 80% of the world’s pollution is created by corporations, not individuals**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Do you think our design and startup teams sometimes neglect ethics not out of malice or some economic quandary, but simply because they did not even think that far…? They might just think about functionality and aesthetics and don’t even go to the ethics piece in their minds…and they are totally led by their biases without realising it at all… so maybe it’s our responsibility to make people more aware…to give them that lightbulb moment… especially very junior or inexperienced designers**

Justin Slack:  **Absolutely Liz. The switch to individual responsibility is not accidental.**

Tess Gouws:  **I think Amazon is too far gone. It won't change while Jeff is involved.**

Tess Gouws:  **During lockdown they made their staff pee in cups instead of taking a bathroom break.**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **Totally agree, Karen. Mostly it’s not malicious, but people being misinformed, or just not knowing enough**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Bezos stepped down today btw. Head of AWS is taking his place.**

Tess Gouws:  **Amazon won't change because they don't have to.**

barrybotha:  **It is naive to think there aren’t two sides. If I buy my kids games that have predatory design principles I am feeding the beast.**

Tess Gouws:  **@Karen really??**

Dylan:  **whaaaat**

barrybotha:  **He is still going to be the chairman**

Kitso Sedumedi:  **I feel as designers it is a moral code of sorts, we have no one to answer to, when it comes to what Vincent is saying.**

Schalk Venter:  **@Karen that is such a great question. I often start my talks on accessibility with the fact that the South African constitution and equality act defines discrimination by means of omission/unintentionally as the same as intentional discrimination.**

barrybotha:  **Yeah true.**

Bianca:  **It’s very much up to company leaders too - I work in advertising and my current company is the first I’ve ever worked at where they have a hard no when it comes to working on firearms, gambling and tobacco products. Very refreshing to work for people who say no.**

barrybotha:  **Thanks Carien !**

Palesa Sibeko:  **micro-transactions that lure kids 😳**

Karen Breytenbach:  **Dankie Carien!!**

Karen Breytenbach:  **https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/tech/jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-amazon-ceo/index.html**

Kitso Sedumedi:  **There isn’t a professional body that regulates designers work, their ethics and moral decisions on designs.**

Ricelle Whelan:  **Nothing stops developers from developing apps, without designers involvement**

Tess Gouws:  **Great Bianca.. good to hear there is some hope out there, lol**

Liesel Bester:  **https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373290/intel-bleep-ai-powered-abuse-toxicity-gaming-filters**

Tess Gouws:  **There's no Designer's version of the hippocratic oath**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **@Ricelle that’s a good point. So saying ethics is the designer’s responsibility is not really a solution**

barrybotha:  **That is mad**

Karen Breytenbach:  **It’s an “opt out” model for racsism**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **To be fair, the hippocratic oath is not legally binding**

Tess Gouws:  **Exactly**

Tess Gouws:  **but it is some form of agreement to general decency and a basic code of ethics**

Vincent Hofmann:  **There are some types of religious groups in society which test the Hippocratic oath all the time.**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **But yes, you’d kind of hope you doctor would aim to do no harm. At least it specifically makes them aware that this is an expectation**

Vincent Hofmann:  **Ethics of care is a fascinating subject.**

Tess Gouws:  **South Africa is a great example of how effective 'legal' is in practice**

Schalk Venter:  **Tess there are actually a lot great ones within the world of tech: https://www.contributor-covenant.org**

Tess Gouws:  **Indeed @ Vincent.**

Tess Gouws:  **nice Schalk! thanks for that!**

Tess Gouws:  **Should have the same things fir designers.**

Schalk Venter:  **I highly encourage everyone to also check out: https://techworkerscoalition.org/**

Tess Gouws:  **Guys I have to run :(**

Lizette Spangenberg:  **Thanks for joining!**

Tess Gouws:  **please do share the recording, this is more good convo**

barrybotha:  **Interland is an example of a game used for good - teaching kids to be safe on the net. Just as much fun for kids with actual gameplay and not just dopamine hit driven.**

Candice Sergeant:  **Dang, need to jump off the call. Suuuper interesting convos here, please do share the recording after! :) Thanks everyone!**

barrybotha:  **How do we feel about using darker game mechanics like scarcity and fear of loss being used for good things ?**

Ricelle Whelan:  **In an ideal world with great ethics. What happens to companies that rely on unethical behavior and probably wont exist without it.?**

Christine Moore:  **Thank you so much, sorry that I have to jump off early. This was a super interesting conversation. Thank you to the panel!**

Bertus Kock:  **Yes please**

Liesel Bester:  **Np, bye.**

barrybotha:  **Yes. I think it would depend on the pattern and the actual product then.**

Bertus Kock:  **Nuclear power?**

barrybotha:  **haha**

Shonhiwa, Mandla:  **Gotta go, thanks guys**

barrybotha:  **Thanks panelists!**

Karen Breytenbach:  **yes and it’s not always taught to designers so they aren’t always forced to think about it…**

Bertus Kock:  **Thanks everyone. This was informative.**

Dumisa Ernstzen:  **Thank you so much everyone this was really eye opening and thought provoking, Looking forward to a follow-up to this!**

Almari Carosini:  **thanks guys!**

Kitso Sedumedi:  **Thanks, listening in was great. Bye**
