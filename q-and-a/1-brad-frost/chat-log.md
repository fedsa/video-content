Albert: **Hi All. Great talk! Hi Brad Do you have any tips regarding this aspect of things? As a developer you know there is always room for improvement and do better but you work only with what you are told or asked to do so the question is: How do you realistically close the gape bewten the visialution and expectation of the client idea as to how it should really be designed? This is because sometimes the client idea is or can be so blur and complex at times?**
