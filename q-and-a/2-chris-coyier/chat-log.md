**Tania Melnyczuk**: Hi, all. My camera is bust, but I can see and hear you all and my microphone is fine. :-)

**Schalk Venter**: No worries Tania! :)

**Tania Melnyczuk**: You're recording this right? So we can replay afterwards?

**Schalk Venter**: Yup. Recording

**Tania Melnyczuk**: Cool!

**Tania Melnyczuk**: I have CSS Hero installed but it hasn't helped me much because some of my syntax knowledge esp. in respect of selections is sooo bad! I use CSS with Divi, BTW.

**Tania Melnyczuk**: :-D

**Jonathan Aspeling**: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background

**Jonathan Aspeling**: ^ How to do your own custom one

**Tania Melnyczuk**: Nice, thanks!

**Tania Melnyczuk**: Sounds like a PhD thesis topic.

**Tania Melnyczuk**: Haha

**Tania Melnyczuk**: I have a harmonica...

**Shailen**: I have 6 guitars :)

**Tania Melnyczuk**: Meeeeeeeeeeee

**Justin Slack**: Post questions in the chat everyone

**Boats**: CSS has come a long way since 1.0, and in a way you have watched it mature, are you happy with where we are with CSS? or are there some things you would change if you could?

**Kurt Muller**: Hi Chris! Your thoughts on CSS in JS or keeping them separate? What's your preference? :)

**Schalk Venter**: As Justin mentioned you can post questions here and we'll ask them in the call. :)

**Schalk Venter**: So keep them coming!

**Shailen**: Any regrets about CSS tricks?

**Johannes**: Looking forward to the next 5 years, what are you most excited about in front-end dev?

**Boats**: what was your favorite bit of tech that you have coded?

**Tania Melnyczuk**: That's like having a Facebook page without having a Web site. :-P

**Boats**: What tech is on the horizon that you are most excited about/ keeping your eye on?

**Nathan Shepherd**: You've managed to successfully identify and address key needs in the online community with regards to tooling (CodePen) and learning (CSS Tricks & Shoptalk Show). What other under-served or neglected areas of the online community, if any, would you like to see addressed or developed?

**Jonathan Aspeling**: Do you have recommendations as to structured training, courses etc. for someone starting out and wanting to level up their css? 

**Johannes**: Do you think the JAMStack (esp. something like Gatsby) is the next big thing (a la WordPress), or just a passing fad?

**Kurt Muller**: Do you believe AMP should become a non-negotiable when developing sites?

**Brendon Pretorius**: Do you have any advice/rule-of-thumb for determining if you want to actively support older browser versions (or edge-case browsers)? Such as if adding fallbacks is worth the effort or using older methodology instead of more modern methodology (using flex/grid vs not)

**Schalk Venter**: Damn, I've been using h-tag elements inside summary all over the place :(

**Schalk Venter**: Didn't know about the semantic/accessibility problems.

**Nathan Shepherd**: Yea, scoped styles are a big win for me.

**Justin Slack**: Schalk do you want to take some questions

**Schalk Venter**: Sure!

**Schalk Venter**: Here is the link to the learning CSS + HTML in 2020 article that I mentioned: https://css-tricks.com/where-do-you-learn-html-css-in-2020/

**Schalk Venter**: Here is link to AMP for anyone not familiar with it: https://amp.dev/

**Kurt Muller**: There's the notion that site that have an AMP site get SERP preference on Google

**Jonathan Aspeling**: Small emergency my side - needing to leave! Chrz all 

**Schalk Venter**: Cool. No worries Jonathan!

**Kurt Muller**: checks css-tricks in IE11 :)

**Nathan Shepherd**: #letitbebroken The first time I ever installed another browser (Chrome) was when the default install of IE couldn't run anything anymore.

**Leandri Nieuwoudt**: Long live jamstack! üíÉ

**Justin Slack**: I have one more too

**Schalk Venter**: Cool. Justin you can end us off with your question then.
